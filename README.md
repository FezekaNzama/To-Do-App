## Project Description
This To Do App Project was built with the intention of helping me practice my newly acquired Spring Boot knowledge. It allows user to create, read, edit and delete any note. Each note consists of a title and a description. 

## Project Tech Stack & Reasoning
- Spring Boot Framework / Java: The goal of this project was to practice my API building with Spring Boot, thus the use of the Spring Boot Framework was a central part of this project. Additionally, Spring Boot serves as a powerful framework for building web applications. 
- Next.js: I chose Next.js because of how quickly it is possible to build beautiful frontend single web apps using react components.
